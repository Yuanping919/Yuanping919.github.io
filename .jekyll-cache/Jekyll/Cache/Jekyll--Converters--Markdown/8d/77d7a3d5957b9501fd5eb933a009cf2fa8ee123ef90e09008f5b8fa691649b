<h2 id="experience">EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p><strong>Quantitative Research Intern</strong>, QTG Capital, Shanghai, China</p>
<ul>
  <li>CTA macroeconomic factor screening: back-tested more than 400 macro variables corresponding to seven types of black futures, and analyzed the rolling correlation.</li>
  <li>CTA high-frequency volume and price factor research: Using futures tick data, studied the effect of high-frequency volume and price factors on 50 futures varieties, including commodities and stock indexes; also studied the impact on the price prediction of different futures for certain periods.</li>
  <li>After applying research to the Chinese A market, the overall regression results of some stocks in the computer industry on the Sci-tech Innovation Board achieved a significance level of 10% both in-sample and out-of-sample.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Investment Department Intern</strong>, Harvest Fund, Beijing, China</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed FOF strategy based on heavy-weighted name information of each fund and predicted the trends of price movement; identified the technical indicators such as bottom reversal and top flip.</li>
  <li>Optimized the timing of beta hedging and dynamically adjusted hedging ratio with equity index futures (IF/IC), which increased the return rate of back-test strategy from 19% to 24% with no extra volatility.</li>
  <li>Shortlisted all available fixed income funds in Chinese market to build momentum strategies; backtested data from 2017 onwards and achieved an annualized return of 9% and 180-day return over 3%.</li>
  <li>Automated the process of calculating the return rate of Harvest Fund portfolios.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="projects">PROJECTS</h2>
<p><strong>Quantitative Research in Implied Volatility Rooted Mean Square Error (IVRMSE</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Used closed-form expansion of expire time (Tau) and moneyness (K) from implied volatility surface to calculate in-sample and out-of-sample IVRMSE in non-parametric model; employed Empirical Martingale Simulation to reduce the in-sample IVRMSE by 10%.</li>
  <li>Employed Matrix Estimation to calculate parameters of Heston model under exact identification; calculated and compared corresponding IVRMSE.</li>
</ul>
